      <description>After 2 years with a Thinkpad X200, I decided to try out an X230 and see if it was worth the upgrade.
Short story - yes.
Having a decade old machine is fine for most tasks including - watching videos, writing, powering two monitors, programming, and other general tasks. However, when it came to heavy javascript usage on web browsers, well, one becomes very judicious with their web browsing on an old machine, which isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.</description>

      <description>The search for the ultimate carry-on travel backpack was an insanely long process, but I believe I finally found the best hybrid travel/hiking/daily backpack. I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty minimalist for about three years now and have travelled perhaps too much for the past 10. But ironically, I never found the perfect piece of luggage. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to travel frequently or for long stretches of time (1 month to 1 year), I have learnt from experience, having the right luggage can make the difference between coping and enjoying your trip.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a free software guy. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using some &amp;lsquo;nix (Linux/BSD) so long, that I can&amp;rsquo;t work on a machine where caps lock is not mapped to ctrl. I get so frustrated in gui&amp;rsquo;s that I instinctively yell for imaginary children to get off my non-existent lawn. Since 2004, I had only used Thinkpad X or T series. So when I finally bought a Macbook Air in 2011, to the salesperson&amp;rsquo;s amusement, I told them I&amp;rsquo;d probably return it in a week or so.</description>
