      <description>After 2 years with a Thinkpad X200, I decided to try out an X230 and see if it was worth the upgrade.
Short story - yes.
Having a decade old machine is fine for most tasks including - watching videos, writing, powering two monitors, programming, and other general tasks. However, when it came to heavy javascript usage on web browsers, well, one becomes very judicious with their web browsing on an old machine, which isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a free software guy. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using some &amp;lsquo;nix (Linux/BSD) so long, that I can&amp;rsquo;t work on a machine where caps lock is not mapped to ctrl. I get so frustrated in gui&amp;rsquo;s that I instinctively yell for imaginary children to get off my non-existent lawn. Since 2004, I had only used Thinkpad X or T series. So when I finally bought a Macbook Air in 2011, to the salesperson&amp;rsquo;s amusement, I told them I&amp;rsquo;d probably return it in a week or so.</description>
