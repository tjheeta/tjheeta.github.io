      <description>The search for the ultimate carry-on travel backpack was an insanely long process, but I believe I finally found the best hybrid travel/hiking/daily backpack. I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty minimalist for about three years now and have travelled perhaps too much for the past 10. But ironically, I never found the perfect piece of luggage. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to travel frequently or for long stretches of time (1 month to 1 year), I have learnt from experience, having the right luggage can make the difference between coping and enjoying your trip.</description>
